# Side-Rail Refinement Campaign — Progress & Review Log

> Autonomous campaign: one rail area refined per ~30 min until the user returns.
> Each entry records **what was OLD** (before) and **what is NEW** (after), with
> the PR link. This file is the running record for team review; a polished `.docx`
> can be exported from it on request (`pandoc docs/REFINE_PROGRESS.md -o review.docx`).

**Cadence note:** `CronCreate`/`ScheduleWakeup` aren't available in this
environment, so the 30-min interval is driven by a background timer + PR-event
wakes (self-paced), not a true cron.

**Standing guardrails (every entry):** one branch per area
(`claude/refine-<area>`), draft PR, CI green (format/typecheck/lint/build),
CodeRabbit-clean, then squash-merge (user away). UI + additive reads only — no
migrations, auth, `lib/supabase` client, `proxy.ts`, middleware, or `app/login`
changes. Tokens-only; 15 brain slugs stable; Admin in Settings; no lockfiles.

## Entries (OLD → NEW)

### [2] Source of Truth — 2026-06-07 — PR #108

**OLD:** `/trust` redirects into the dashboard hero (owned by the Dashboard
area), so the real surface here is the **Fund Profile**. Its six LP-probed
section cards rendered empty fields as **dead text** — an operator looking at the
canonical record couldn't act on a missing thesis / terms / team from the page
itself; only the separate Gaps card linked anywhere. No per-section status, so
the record wasn't scannable.
**NEW (functionality):** every **empty** section card — and the empty team
state — is now a link into the profile builder (`/onboarding`) with a hover
lift, matching the Gaps card. Present sections stay read-mostly.
**NEW (visual, bold not flat):** each section carries an **"On record" / "Add"**
status chip (shared `Badge`) so the Source of Truth is scannable at a glance;
empty cards get a warning-tinted icon disc + an "Add the team" affordance.
**NEW (correctness):** chips use the shared `Badge` instead of the undefined
`--*-soft` CSS vars (those live only in the un-imported design-reference sheet);
empty icon disc uses the defined `--warning` token like the Gaps card. Fixed a
stale "Eleanor" voice reference in the Hero doc comment.
**Files:** `components/fund-profile/FundProfileSections.tsx`,
`components/fund-profile/FundProfileHero.tsx`.
**Checks:** tsc/lint/format ✓ · build via CI · CodeRabbit pending.

### [1] Earn modal — 2026-06-07 — PR #107

**OLD:** The Earn dock's "Here's what I can do right now" quick-action chips and
the specialist rows were **dead** — the dock's own comment promised they
"pre-seed the EarnChat input", but nothing connected them to `EarnChat`, which
owned its input state internally. Tapping a chip did nothing; selecting a
specialist only revealed a one-liner. The dock also read fairly flat.
**NEW (functionality):** `EarnChat` exposes an imperative `seed(text)` handle
(`forwardRef` + `useImperativeHandle`); `EarnDock` holds a chat ref and seeds it
from (a) every quick-action chip and (b) a new **"Ask &lt;name&gt; to step in"**
button on the active specialist. Seeding fills + focuses the input (caret at end)
and does **not** auto-send, so the operator edits before firing. `/api/ask-earn`
chat path untouched.
**NEW (visual, bold not flat):** gold top-accent bar on the dock; chips gain a
gold hover/focus surface, gold icon tint on hover, and a sliding arrow; the
specialist CTA is gold.
**NEW (perf/correctness):** no `setState`-in-effect (React-Compiler lint clean);
seeding runs in the click handler. Standalone `/ask-earn` usage unaffected.
**Files:** `components/shell/earn/EarnDock.tsx`, `app/ask-earn/EarnChat.tsx`.

### [0] Rail brand: F → Earn avatar (+ live flags) — 2026-06-07 — PR #106 ✅ merged

**OLD:** The side-rail brand mark was a flat gold rounded-square showing the
letter **"F"**. Rail nav still flagged `/objections` and `/inbox-intelligence`
as "SOON" even though their UIs shipped in the swarm (#104 / #105).
**NEW:** Brand mark is now the real **Earn coin** (`<EarnCoin size={30} />`,
`public/earn-coin.png` on a white disc) — the OS now wears Earn's face, gold
still reserved for Earn. Flipped `/objections` and `/inbox-intelligence` to
`live: true` so the rail no longer shows a "Soon" pill on shipped surfaces;
`/materials` stays SOON (preview only).
**Files:** `components/shell/Wave1SideRail.tsx`, `components/shell/rail-nav.ts`.

### Swarm convergence (areas 4–6) — 2026-06-07

The 5-wide refinement swarm landed three area passes ahead of the serial
campaign; logged here for the team record (full OLD→NEW in each PR body):

- **Capital Formation** (#104) — capital-stack tone accents + LP-type donut;
  pipeline `Intl` currency + React-Compiler derived state; **Objections** built
  from a ComingSoon stub into a full triage module over existing RPCs.
- **Deal Execution** (#103) — real `/deal-desk`, `/ic-memos`, `/governance`
  surfaces; tokenized CTA gradient; compact-USD rollover fix; parallel fetches.
- **Intelligence** (#105) — real `/inbox-intelligence`, `/knowledge`,
  `/materials`, `/partners` surfaces; `getMemberByFirstName` roster helper.
